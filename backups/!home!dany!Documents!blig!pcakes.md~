# Cakes
Obvi cakes are delicious. Even more delicious are little cute cakes. I consumed
said cakes from a cafe in the Beirut airport after sampling some single malt
whisky from the duty free at 4 am. It was classy, to say the least. The cakes
came in a bag, which, arguably, is the best medium to carry tiny cakes in. There
were three of them, each oblong and with a sort of matte glaze. Beauts. They sat
in a row on my palm like
```Clojure

They were mostly bullshit&mdashthey didn't really taste like much. It **was**
airport food, afterall. One of them was a pistachio cake. It was cute, sounded
pretty bougie, and also I figured they would be a pretty good breakfast. So I decided to
recreate them.

Unfortunately, I don't own a pan with oblong molds&mdash;because I'm not a
ridiculous human. So I had to settle for a cupcake tin.

I followed [this](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/08/cook-the-book-mini-pistachio-tea-cakes-recipe.html) recipe
generally and made the pistachio paste by following another recipe I found online. 

Oh and, the whisky was some Macallan aged in oak casks. It had been refrigerated
so I couldn't taste much other than the oak. I was also not ready for whisky at
that time of day (night?). As an aside, I would probably never buy a bottle of
Macallan. (post to come?)
