* Questions and Answers
** Why are you leaving your current job?
It happened progrssively. There were several points where I realized
"hey maybe this isn't the best place for me." For example:
- Someone showing me a table they thought was really interesting,
  showing the serial number of each relay in the plant
- Coworkers getting excited about high power hardware when I a not
  excited by it
- Not enjoying work at a power plant
- Not enjoying projects with other groups in the company
- Not being excited about the open phase analysis work that we would
  be performing for a new plant

Ultimately, it came down to wanting to be challenged more at work, to
work in a faster paced environment and to work on software. I find
myself jumping on all the software tasks at work and when I get home,
I am eager to work on my own projects, which are generally software
related. Work at my current job is really comfortable. We don't do
design work, mainly analysis, hardware commissioning, testing and
qualification. The industry is really old, most of the problems have
been solved; it's typically a matter of impleenting those solutions or
analysis techniques. I really don't feel challenged by this work the
way I thought I would be. 

The industry is currently really concerned with a fault which power
transformers can experience referred to as "open phase conditions."
The group I work with has become the industry leader when it comes to
analyzing plant behavior during these conditions. Every nuclear power
plant in the country is required by the NRC to perform the analysis on
their plant and install the industry-wide recommended solution. This
is at least a couple more years worth of work for us. I am really not
excited about it.

Ultimately, it comes down to wanting a bigger challenge at work. The
electric power industry is very antiquated; most hardware we work with
was built in the 70's using technology developed at the turn of the
previous century. I work in the electric analysis group at MPR and a
large portion of the work we do involves analyzing how a nuclear power
plant will behave under certain conditions and determining whether
the behavior is within the legal operating limit of the
plant. The first few months of this were interesting since I was
learning new things and getting a better feel for the
industry. These past couple of months, I've started feeling that even
though the problems I face at work are new, the way we go about
solving them is typically the same, no new theory or new difficulty is
involved. 

I also want something faster paced. Plants are very slow to adopt new
technology and the 

** Why $comp?
Factual is the place for me to really feel like I am having an imapct
on some of the most pressing and exciting areas in software right
now. I want to work on developing better ways to target users with ads
that are helpful to them and the ad poster. I'm also really excited
about the technology being used; Apache distributed computing and
Clojure functional approach are things I'm really excited about
working with on a large scale.
DRAKE??!!! Cool stuff! I feel that it would be really useful at my
current job! Data processing really is a mess!


** Why software?
I've always been eager to learn about software. I really like learning
about algorithms and their optimziations as well as data structures
and their best use cases. I really enjoy reading through someone
else's code and figuring out what is going on -- it's like a timless virtual
human connection.
** What are your plans for the future?
I want to be an industry expert on tools for scientists, engineers and
educators. I want to be on the forefront of the development of the
best tools which can be used to solve the world's most critical and
interesting problems.
